# AES-RSA-Encryption
A client-server application with confidential message exchange to provide authentication, integrity and key sharing among both the client and server with the help of RSA and AES algorithm. <br>
This contains six python files representing various methods required. The main functions of these files are:
* __client_main.py__ : Representing the Client side
* __server_main.py__ : Representing the Server side
* __aes_encryption.py__ : Has the functions required to implement Simpled AES encryption
* __aes_decryption.py__ : Has the functions to implement Simplified AES decryption
* __hashalgo.py__ : Has the function to implement the hash algorithm
* __rsa_algo.py__ : Has the function to implement the RSA algorithm
